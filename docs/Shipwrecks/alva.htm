<img src="alva.gif" height="200" width="250" align="BOTTOM"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday, July 23, 1892,
the <b>Metropolitan Steamship Company</b> freight steamer <b><i>H.F. Dimock</i></b> left New York
at 6 pm laden with freight and a few passengers on a twenty hour trip to Boston via Long
Island Sound. Captain A.B. Coleman was in command of the 300' long 2,625 GT <i>Dimock</i> and her
crew of 27 officers and men.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b><i>Alva</i></b>, named for William K. Vanderbilt's wife, was designed by St.
Clare J. Byrne as a three-masted bark-rigged screw steamer with a steel hull. <b>The Harlan
&amp; Hollingsworth Company</b> built the <i>Alva</i> at Wilmington, Delaware, and launched her
October 15, 1886. The <i>Alva</i> had an overall length of 285', and a length on the waterline of
252'. Her measurements were as follows, extreme beam 32.25', depth 21.5', and draft 17'.
Her tonnage was 1,151.27 gross and 600.55 net.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late Saturday afternoon, the <i>Alva</i> departed Bar Harbor bound for Newport. Captain Henry
Morrison, a sturdy Englishman, was in command of the <i>Alva</i>. The <i>Alva</i>'s crew totaled 52 men,
including officers. Proceeding South, Sunday morning, the <i>Alva</i> encountered a dense fog off
Monomoy Point. Immediately, the <i>Alva</i>'s crew sounded her steam whistle. The <i>Alva</i> anchored
at precisely 6:30 am to wait for a clearing. Although he did not know it at that time,
Captain Morrison had anchored the <i>Alva</i> in Pollock Rip Channel, about 4.1 miles East of
Monomoy Point Lighthouse.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 8:20 am, a tremendous crash followed by the sound of flying timbers and deck
fittings instantly brought everyone to the <i>Alva</i>'s deck with little more than the clothes
on their backs. Captain Morrison went forward to examine the damage and found a mortal
wound in the <i>Alva</i>'s port side. He gave the order to abandon ship. Eventually, everyone
made it from the <i>Alva</i> to the <i>Dimock</i>, which had anchored about 500 yards from the <i>Alva</i>.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At W.K. Vanderbilt's direction, the tug <b><i>Rescue</i></b> of the <b>Merritt Wrecking
Company </b>steamed Eastward through Nantucket Sound and reached the <i>Alva</i>'s side late Tuesday
afternoon, July 26, 1892. On board the <i>Rescue</i> were a full wrecking crew under the command
of Captain E. Sharpe, the company's chief wrecker and diver. They decided the <i>Alva</i> could
not be saved and Thursday, August 4, 1892, the <i>Alva</i> was sold at auction for $3,500.00 to
<b>Perkins &amp; White</b>, contractors from Boston. Within a year, the <i>Alva</i> was declared a
menace to navigation and blown up.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a century after the first divers visited her, the <i>Alva</i> remains a wonderful
dive site. Only reachable by boat, the run from Cape Cod to the <i>Alva</i> takes about an hour.
After crossing Handkerchief Shoal and rounding the sometimes treacherous Southern tip of
Monomoy Island, continue four miles Easterly toward the end of Pollock Rip Channel.
Nearing Pollock Rip red nun No. 4, you are within a 1/4 mile of the <i>Alva</i> at latitude 41<sup>o</sup> -33
North and longitude 069<sup>o</sup> -54 West.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Alva</i> lies upright on a white sand bottom with her bow heading in a
West-Northwesterly direction. Her high profile bow is the most prominent feature. The
maximum depth is about 45', with about 35' over the tallest remaining structure.
Visibility is typically at least 20' to 30'. At times, visibility can be 50' or more.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For photography and sightseeing, there is abundant marine life. Fish such as striped
bass, cunners, tautog, sand sharks, etc. abound. Kelp and encrusting animals cover remains
of the blown up hull and machinery. For wreck divers, there are no areas for penetration,
but some nice artifacts can still be found (such as the unique rectangular brass porthole
recovered by Doug Maier on May 26, 1996).<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter 1995/96 shifted a little sand here and there, uncovering some parts and burying
others, but not much has changed on the <i>Alva</i> since last year. Starting from the aft end,
the most prominent feature is a large steam windlass. Moving Westerly along the starboard
side, you pass four lifeboat davits that appear like arms reaching out of the sand, sort
of beckoning the strong currents at this site to slow. But, the currents persist and you
pull-and-glide your way past the remains of machinery spaces and owner's quarters.
Continuing forward, you see the chain locker with its large exposed links and follow the
path to the massive anchor clearly visible a little off to the starboard side of center.
Approaching the foredeck at the bow, you can squeeze past the remains of a marine head
into a tight compartment that often holds a few large lobsters... almost always just out
of reach. Dropping down to the sand, you can pass under the <i>Alva</i>'s sharp bow which still
stands proud of the bottom. While there, you look up and see a beautiful profile of this
once elegant beauty set against a background of glimmering sunlight and bountiful fish.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than seventeen years after the <i>Alva</i>'s demise, the <i>Dimock</i> sunk another ship in
almost the identical location. The <i>Dimock</i>'s second victim was the 297' passenger steamer <b><i><i>Horatio
Hall</i>.</i></b></p>
