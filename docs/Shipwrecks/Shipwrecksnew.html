      Numerous ships have gone down off the New England Coast during the past
      couple of centuries. Here, we'll try to tell you more about some of the
      ones contemporary sport divers visit.<br />

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="../../peoplePics/poling.htm">Chester A. Poling</a> A favorite
        dive site off Cape Ann, the stern of this ship is a favorite for many
        MWDC members. Also included here is a photo from an October 1995 night
        dive on the Poling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="../../peoplePics/anchor1.html">City of Salisbury </a> Steve
        Simpson compiled several news articles concerning recovery of the
        massive anchor from this Cape Ann shipwreck. Also included are some
        photos that document this accomplishment. (Note, this link takes you to
        Steve's Web site. Please come &quot;back&quot; to the MWDC Web site
        after you learn about the City of Salisbury.)

      <li>
        <a href="../../peoplePics/monomoy.htm">Shipwrecks of Monomoy Island</a>:
        During the past two centuries, more than 3,000 ships have gone down in
        the waters East of Cape Cod. Here you will find some specific
        information about some of our favorite shipwreck dive sites in that
        region of coastal Massachusetts.
