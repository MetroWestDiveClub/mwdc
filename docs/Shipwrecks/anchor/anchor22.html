      DANVERS - Fifty-seven years to the day after the freighter City of
      Salisbury sank off the Nahant coast, Danversport-based wreck divers spent
      a harrowing Saturday to retrieve a 6,000-pound piece of history. <br />Now
      the British ship's bamacle encrusted 13-foot anchor sits behind Northeast
      Scuba on Liberty Street. <br />But it didn't come easy - the salvage
      effort required the cooperation of a variety of area businesses and was
      painstakingly slow. <br />&quot;It's not the prettiest thing to come out
      of the New England waters in recent years, but it's one of the largest.
      It's huge,&quot; said diver Michael Miller of Danvers. &quot;For four guys
      diving over the weekend, it was a good haul.&quot; <br />Known now as the
      &quot;Zoo Wreck,&quot; the nearly 6,000-ton vessel was bound from India to
      Boston with an exotic cargo of birds, monkeys, pythons, cobras and other
      animals. <br />The freighter was within sight of Boston Harbor when it was
      engulfed by dense fog and struck an uncharted pinnacle of rock on Graves
      Ledge on April 22,1938. Efforts to save the 419-foot freighter failed but
      the entire 56-member crew and most of the cargo was rescued. One large
      decomposed python eventually washed ashore and was mistaken for a sea
      serpent by local residents. <br />Two weeks ago, Jeff Hannigan of
      Tewksbury had been diving on the wreck of the City of Salisbury and told
      Miller and fellow divers Stephen Galperin of Manchester, N.H., and Mehmet
      Mandalinci of Methuen that he saw the anchor.

      <br />The divers went and surveyed the site, estimating the anchor's
      weight at nearly 6,000 pounds. They planned to salvage it last Friday
      using five 1,000-pound inflatable lift bags, Miller said. <br />&quot;It
      was barely buoyant enough to get it to the surface,&quot; he said. Just as
      the group was ready to tow the anchor, it brushed the side of their boat,
      the D/V Depth Charge, burst one of the bags and sunk again. <br />The
      divers had originally found the anchor at a depth of 57 feet, but were
      fortunate that when it sank again, it landed on a ledge 35 feet
      underwater, said Miller. If it had gone down 65 to 70 feet, they wouldn't
      have had enough power at their disposal to retrieve it. <br />Faith
      Ortins, co-owner of Northeast Scuba, then went to Rhode Island to get a
      2,000-pound lift bag to assist in the salvage. The divers returned
      Saturday and this time were able to lift and tow the anchor from Graves
      Light to Hawthorne Cove Marina in Salem Harbor. <br />&quot;A major
      concern was that it would sink on the way back,&quot; said Mandalinci, who
      noted that there were depths of up to 100 feet along the way. <br />As a
      result, it took eight hours to tow the anchor at a speed of about 2 knots.
      <br />&quot;The anchor was so heavy if it sank, it would have taken the
      boat down with it,&quot; said Galperin. &quot;We stood by with a knife to
      cut the float.&quot; <br />Mandalinci said things also got tricky when
      they reached Salem Harbor.

      <br />&quot;Our most critical point was at the end because we had a whole
      group of moorings&quot; to dodge in the harbor, he said. &quot;If it
      wasn't for the skillful maneuvering of our captain, Jeff, we would have
      lost it. it was very nerve-wracking. You could walk faster than the boat
      was going.&quot;

      <br />Once safely in the harbor, Hawthorne Cove Marina used its 35-ton
      travel lift to hoist the anchor onto a flatbed truck, said marina owner
      Nina Vickers. That was also a precarious job, because the winds and the
      anchor's fragile condition made things difficult, she said. Riverview
      Landscaping of Middleton then brought the anchor to Northeast Scuba
      yesterday morning and set it down behind the business using a backhoe,
      said Miller. <br />The anchor will be left alone for a week to dry off and
      then will be cleaned of loose rust and polished for display, he said.
      <br />&quot;It's our lawn ornament, &quot; Miller said, adding that the
      public is invited to come look at it. &quot;We don't think it was the
      actual main anchor of the wreck,&quot; but probably a spare. <br />The
      divers said they were unaware of the anniversary until they had already
      begun towing the anchor. <br />&quot;It was fate,&quot; said Mandalinci.
      &quot;It was 57 years to the day and we didn't even realize it until we
      looked at a book.&quot;
