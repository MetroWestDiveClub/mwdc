Danvers divers salvage
 shipwrecked anchor

         DANVERS - Fifty-seven
         years to the day after the
  freighter City of Salisbury
  sank off the Nahant coast, Danversport-based wreck divers spent a
  harrowing Saturday to retrieve a
  6,000-pound piece of history.

   Now the British ship's bamacle encrusted 13-foot anchor sits
  behind Northeast Scuba on Liberty
  Street.

   But it didn't come easy - the salvage effort required the 
cooperation of a variety of area businesses
  and was painstakingly slow.

   "It's not the prettiest thing to
  come out of the New England
  waters in recent years, but it's one
  of the largest.  It's huge," said diver
  Michael Miller of Danvers.  "For
  four guys diving over the weekend,
  it was a good haul."
   Known now as the "Zoo Wreck,"
  the nearly 6,000-ton vessel was
  bound from India to Boston with an
  exotic cargo of birds, monkeys,
  pythons, cobras and other animals.
   The freighter was within sight of
  Boston Harbor when it was engulfed by dense fog and struck an
  uncharted pinnacle of rock on
  Graves Ledge on April 22,1938.
  Efforts to save the 419-foot freighter
  failed but the entire 56-member
  crew and most of the cargo was rescued.  One large decomposed
  python eventually washed ashore
  and was mistaken for a sea serpent
 by local residents.

   Two weeks ago, Jeff Hannigan of
 Tewksbury had been diving on the
 wreck of the City of Salisbury and
 told Miller and fellow divers
 Stephen Galperin of Manchester,
 N.H., and Mehmet Mandalinci of
 Methuen that he saw the anchor.
   The divers went and surveyed
 the site, estimating the anchor's
 weight at nearly 6,000 pounds.  They
 planned to salvage it last Friday
 using five 1,000-pound inflatable lift
 bags, Miller said.

   "It was barely buoyant enough to
 get it to the surface," he said.
   Just as the group was ready to

  tow the anchor, it brushed the side
  of their boat, the D/V Depth
  Charge, burst one of the bags and
  sunk again.
    The divers had originally found
  the anchor at a depth of 57 feet, but
  were fortunate that when it sank
  again, it landed on a ledge 35 feet
  underwater, said Miller.  If it had
  gone down 65 to 70 feet, they
  wouldn't have had enough power
  at their disposal to retrieve it.
    Faith Ortins, co-owner of Northeast Scuba, then went to Rhode
  Island to get a 2,000-pound lift bag
  to assist in the salvage.  The divers
  returned Saturday and this time
  were able to lift and tow the
  anchor from Graves Light to
  Hawthorne Cove Marina in Salem
  Harbor.

   "A major concern was that it
  would sink on the way back," said
  Mandalinci, who noted that there
  were depths of up to 100 feet along
   the way.

     As a result, it took eight hours to
   tow the anchor at a speed of about
   2 knots.

     "The anchor was so heavy if it
   sank, it would have taken the boat
   down with it," said Galperin.  "We
   stood by with a knife to cut the
   float."

     Mandalinci said things also got
   tricky when they reached Salem
   Harbor.

     "Our most critical point was at
   the end because we had a whole
   group of moorings" to dodge in the
   harbor, he said.  "If it wasn't for the
   skillful maneuvering of our captain, Jeff, we would have lost it. it
   was very nerve-wracking.  You
   could walk faster than the boat
   was going."
   Once safely in the harbor,
   Hawthorne Cove Marina used its
   35-ton travel lift to hoist the anchor
   onto a flatbed truck, said marina
   owner Nina Vickers.  That was also
   a precarious job, because the
    winds and the anchor's fragile condition made things difficult, she
    said.
    Riverview Landscaping of Middleton then brought the anchor to
    Northeast Scuba yesterday morning and set it down behind the
    business using a backhoe, said
    Miller.

    The anchor will be left alone for
    a week to dry off and then will be
    cleaned of loose rust and polished
    for display, he said.

    "It's our lawn ornament, " Miller
    said, adding that the public is
    invited to come look at it.  "We
    don't think it was the actual main
    anchor of the wreck," but probably
    a spare.

    The divers said they were
    unaware of the anniversary until
    they had already begun towing the
    anchor.

    "It was fate," said Mandalinci.
    "It was 57 years to the day and we
    didn't even realize it until we
    looked at a book."
