<P>This is the pace to get both maritime historical and dive site information
about the ships that that went down off the coast od Cape Cod. The ones
near Monomoy Island are the most accessible, and they are the focus of
this page.</P>

<P>Located at the elbow of Cape Cod, Monomoy Island (Massachusetts) is
home to a widely varied and abundant wildlife population. To learn more
about the amphibians, birds, fish, mamals, and reptiles of the Cape Cod
National Seashore, check out the on-line National Park Fauna database (National
Park Service and National Biological Survey). For further information about

<li><A HREF="alva.htm">Vanderbilt's Luxury Yacht ALVA</A> Fog played a
key roll in the fate of two vessels. One, a luxury yacht, was bound from
Bar Harbor, Maine to Newport, Rhode Island. The other was an American-built
steamship making one of its numerous trips between New York and Boston.
They would meet off Cape Cod, but one would not complete its journey. </li>

<li><A HREF="aransas.htm">Joy Line Steamer ARANSAS</A> Probably the best
artifact dive in Cape Cod waters.... but she's hard to find. </li>

<li><A HREF="h_hall.htm">Steamer HORATIO HALL</A> In 1892, the Metropolitan
Line's H. F. Dimock sank William K. Vanderbilt's luxury yacht Alva. Seventeen
years later, the Dimock sank another ship, the Horatio Hall, at almost
the same location in Pollock Rip Channel. That narrow passage was part
of the main New York to Boston shipping route, running Easterly from the
Southern tip of Monomoy Island at the elbow of Cape Cod. This is the story
of the Hall's demise. </li>

<li><A HREF="pendleto.htm">T-2 Tanker PENDLETON</A> No matter what your
dive objective, you will have ample time at a maximum depth of about 35'.
This dive site offers visibility that generally exceeds 20'. Relatively
warm Summer water temperatures often reach into the low 70's. Be aware
of the moderate to strong currents during tide changes and dive only around
the time of slack water. Her remains now offer some of the best lobster
habitat to be found in this region.</li>
