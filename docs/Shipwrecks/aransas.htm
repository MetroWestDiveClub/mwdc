<h1>Joy Line Steamer ARANSAS</h1>

<h2><b><i>Haulin' Brass</i></b></h2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built at Wilmington, DL in 1877 for the Southern Pacific Railway, the <b><i>Aransas</i></b>
was a 241.0' long passenger and freight steamer. Her iron hull had four bulkheads. She had
twin screws and her steam engines produced 650 indicated HP (350 nominal HP). For those of
you who like to know such trivia, other significant information for this ship includes:
Official No. 105749, call sign &quot;JSRV&quot;, typical crew 36, beam 35.5', depth 16.5',
and tonnage 1,156.78 gross and 678.73 net. The <b><i>Aransas</i></b>' original home port was New
Orleans, LA. After sale to the Joy line, her home port changed to New York City around
1900. In 1904, the <b><i>Aransas</i></b> began a regular run between Boston and NYC. It was on one of
these routine trips the <b><i>Aransas</i></b> career came to an abrupt end.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under command of Captain Ezra C. Rood, the <b><i>Aransas</i></b> left Boston soon after 5 pm Saturday
evening May 6, 1905. The balance of the crew for this trip included First Officer C.P.
Crocker, Second Officer D.C. Merritt, and 26 other personnel. From her berth at the South
Boston end of the Congress Street Bridge, she headed to NYC. On this trip, the <b><i>Aransas</i></b>
carried 37 passengers and a 600 ton cargo that included a variety of brass scrap material.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half way across Massachusetts Bay, Captain Rood slowed the <b><i>Aransas</i></b>' speed due to fog.
Around 1 am, she cautiously approached the Easterly end of Pollock Rip Channel in thick
fog and calm seas. She was now about 1.5 miles Southeast of the <b><i>Pollock Rip Lightship</i></b>.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Patience</i></b>, a Reading RR tug, had three coal barges in tow, each separated
by a 200' long hawser. Last in that string was the <b><i>Glendower</i></b>. The <b><i>Patience</i></b>
and her barges were en route Westward to Philadelphia. From the <b><i>Aransas</i></b>, a barge was
sighted dead ahead and she frantically reversed her engines. The barge Glendower struck
the <b><i>Aransas</i></b> nearly amidships on the starboard side. The Glendower was practically
uninjured, but the Joy Line steamer sank in about 15 minutes. Settling by the bow, the
<b><i>Aransas</i></b> rapidly filled with water, and at 1:30 am, Sunday, May 7, 1905, she was gone.
Miss. Anna Field, a 25 year old Boston waitress, was the only fatal victim.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b><i>Aransas</i></b> was explosively cleared decades ago, and now rests upright and sanded-in on
a flat, hard, white sand bottom in 55' of water, 4.9 nm East of Monomoy Island off
Chatham. Her position is latitude 41-35 North and longitude 69-52 West. Her low profile
rises little more than five to six feet above the sea floor. Twin propulsion shafts with
propellers lay almost flush with the sand and facilitate natural navigation from the
boiler section, the <b><i>Aransas</i></b>' most prominent feature, toward the aft end of the ship.
Little remains of her bow, which aims South - Southeasterly, so use a wreck reel if you
want to explore in that direction. Visibility often exceeds 30', with cool Spring
temperatures commonly yielding visibility of 50' or more. As Summer bottom temperatures
rise toward the upper 50's, visibility can sometimes drop toward the 15'-20' range.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of May 1996, early season divers found little had changed on the <b><i>Aransas</i></b>. The net
covered starboard prop is now mostly sanded over, but the port prop and both prop shafts
remain almost fully exposed. Recently revealed in the machinery space, forward of the prop
shafts and aft of the boiler, are some large brass valves and other interesting encrusted
bits of history. Sand has also shifted away from the cargo area forward of the boiler
revealing still more of the <b><i>Aransas</i></b>' past, right down to a hard packed conglomerate. Here,
an artifact hunter's tool bag should include a hammer and chisel (to gently crack items
loose from the conglomerate) and a table tennis paddle on a lanyard (to uncover sanded-in
objects).<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marine life on and around the <b><i>Aransas</i></b> is not as prolific as on other Cape Cod ship
wrecks, due in large part to its relatively small structure protruding above the bottom.
Nevertheless, it is a lovely wreck to visit. Fish typically include hake and cunners, with
striped bass and tautog sometimes present. A variety of encrusting animals can also be
found, ranging from anemones, to sponges and hydroids. In 1993, a massive (this one was
big enough to hurt you) lobster was in residence near mid-ships, always just out of reach.
While there are not many lobsters to be had on the <b><i>Aransas</i></b>, there are a couple of
commercial lobster boats in this area that seem to relish the prospect of diver
harassment, or endangerment as the case may be. A word to the wise here is to always
surface next to the dive boat and promptly report any significant problems to the Chatham
Coast Guard Station on VHF FM channel 16 or call 508/945-3830 or *24 (cellular call to
USCG Rescue Center).<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the best artifact dive in Cape Cod waters, the <b><i>Aransas</i></b> constantly yields parts
of her cargo for sharp-eyed divers. (Note, the <b><i>Aransas</i></b> is in Federal waters and, to the
author's best knowledge and belief, has long since been abandoned by its owner(s). Thus,
it's not likely anyone would object to the recovery of a few mementos by sport divers.
But, unless you take the time to properly secure a clear title to your finds, ownership
could be questioned.) If you do retrieve Aransas artifacts, please don't take more than
you can adequately clean and preserve.<br><br>
