  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a HREF="alva.htm">Vanderbilt's Luxury Yacht ALVA</a> Fog played a key roll in the fate
    of two vessels. One, a luxury yacht, was bound from Bar Harbor, Maine to Newport, Rhode
    Island. The other was an American-built steamship making one of its numerous trips between
    New York and Boston. They would meet off Cape Cod, but one would not complete its journey.</li>
  
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a HREF="aransas.htm">Joy Line Steamer ARANSAS</a> Probably the best artifact dive in
    Cape Cod waters.... but she's hard to find. </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a HREF="h_hall.htm">Steamer HORATIO HALL</a> In 1892, the Metropolitan Line's H. F.
    Dimock sank William K. Vanderbilt's luxury yacht Alva. Seventeen years later, the Dimock
    sank another ship, the Horatio Hall, at almost the same location in Pollock Rip Channel.
    That narrow passage was part of the main New York to Boston shipping route, running
    Easterly from the Southern tip of Monomoy Island at the elbow of Cape Cod. This is the
    story of the Hall's demise. </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a HREF="pendleto.htm">T-2 Tanker PENDLETON</a> No matter what your dive objective, you
    will have ample time at a maximum depth of about 35'. This dive site offers visibility
    that generally exceeds 20'. Relatively warm Summer water temperatures often reach into the
    low 70's. Be aware of the moderate to strong currents during tide changes and dive only
    around the time of slack water. Her remains now offer some of the best lobster habitat to
    be found in this region.</li></p>
