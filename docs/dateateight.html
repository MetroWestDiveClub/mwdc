<p>
Looking to socialize with other divers, don't have a buddy to dive with, or not sure where to dive?

<b>Date @ Eight</b> is the Club's regular weekly dive outing which runs year-round. <b>Divers rendezvous every Saturday morning at 8:00 am (weather and sea conditions permitting) at the Burger King rest area located just after Exit 19 on Route 128 in Beverly, MA</b>. The rest stop is a convenient spot for divers to meet-up, have breakfast, and plan the days diving activities before heading north to selected dive sites located in the Cape Ann area.

</br></br>Not a member? Don't worry, Date @ Eight is open to everyone, and there is no cost or obligation if you would like participate. One or more designated Club representatives will
be present each week to coordinate the outing for any divers interested in
participating - with or without buddies.

</br></br>The Club also periodically organizes weekend visits to other shore and boat sites around Massachusetts and the greater New England area (including New Hampshire and Rhode Island) as new and interesting dive opportunities arise. We have familiar sites, but we also enjoy trying new, safe, fun locations if you have recommendations.

</br></br>Please remember that all divers are responsible for providing and maintaining their own gear.

</br></br><i>Non-members will be asked to show a valid C-card and sign a dive waiver prior to diving. Site locations, days and meeting times are
subject to change according to weather forecasts, prevailing conditions, and diver safety and ability considerations.
For more details and current dive plans, contact the Club representative listed on the left by the Thursday before the dive to let them know you would like to attend.</i>

</br></br>If you have signed up for a dive but are running late,
please notify the Club representative.
