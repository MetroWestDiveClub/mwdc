**A Photographic Journey through the Sea of Cortez on the Rocio del Mar**

Tuesday, January 11th, 2021

This presentation will chronicle our trip in late September to early October
2021 aboard the Rocio del Mar as it sailed the entire Sea of Cortez from Puerto
Penasco in the north to San Jose del Cabo in the south. This trip is offered
only 3 times/year, and the Rocio del Mar is the only boat doing this route. We
will discuss our favorite images, including everything from nudibranchs to
whales, as well as a little bit about the boat and general logistics.
