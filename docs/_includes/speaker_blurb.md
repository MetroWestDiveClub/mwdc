### The Diver’s Guide to Harvest in Massachusetts

<p align=center>presented by <b>Vin Malkoski</b></p>


Many divers are confused by the regulations and more than a few don’t realize that a recreational fishing license is required to take finfish while diving regardless of the gear type used. This presentation is a review of the rules and regulations that apply to diver harvest in MA waters and discussion about the regulations and biology of the animals. Questions are encouraged. Come find out how to stay out of trouble while catching dinner!
