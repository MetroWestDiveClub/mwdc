# MWDC Boat Diving Program

The MetroWest Dive Club's Boat Diving Program charters dive boats throughout the
New England area. The MWDC Boat Charters are open to all **members**. We also
maintain a [list of dive boats](links-boats.html) frequently chartered by MWDC
members.

The beginning of each year a new schedule is worked out by interested club
members and the Boat Dive Coordinator. The schedule usually runs from May to
September, however we sometimes also do some winter Boat Dives during the cold
weather months!

This year's Boat Dive Coordinator is John Williams. They can be contacted at
<boatdiving@mwdc.org>. If you have an idea or request for a boat dive that you
think other members of the club would enjoy as well, please let the Boat Dive
Coordinator know.
