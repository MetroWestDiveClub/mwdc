## The Club

The MetroWest Dive Club (MWDC) is dedicated to promoting fun, safe diving, and
introducing and familiarizing members with new dive sites. We are committed to
encouraging good relations with our coastal neighbors through courtesy and good
diving etiquette, and getting involved with community activities.

The MWDC is not affiliated with any retailer, vendor, or manufacturers. We are a
large group of sport divers with a wide range of scuba diving interests. Club
members can help direct you to the many training classes locally available.

To get involved, feel free to join us at one of <a href="meetings.html">our
meetings</a>, or join us for <a href="dateateight.html">a dive</a>!
