**Ryan King - Hidden Stories and Creative Lighting: Make your Images Pop**

Tuesday, October 12th, 2021

You’ve got the camera and lights, but so does everyone else. How do
you get your images and video to stand out among the crowd? Snoots
are great, but that’s just the beginning. During this session, Ryan
King will explore some simple tools / techniques to help improve the
stories your images tell.

Ryan started diving in 1990 and has never looked back. For over 25
years, Ryan has been diving, teaching, and photographing marine
life, caves, and wrecks from Canada to the Caribbean. He has a
passion for exploration and helping others enjoy and appreciate the
underwater world.
