# MetroWest Dive Club Meetings

Club meetings are held once a month, on the 2nd Tuesday of every month, at the <a href="location-directions.html">Courtyard Marriott on Speen Street in Natick</a>. The meeting typically features a presentation, with the topics ranging from slide shows and video presentations, to dive science and physiology, to marine ecology, and many other fascinating diving-related topcs.

Every meeting also features a raffle of various member-donated prizes. Prizes range from dive gear, books, or just about anything else. Tickets are cheap and prizes worthwhile.

Members start gathering in the bar around 6-6:30pm to socialize and grab a snack, and the actual meeting starts promptly at 7:30pm. During the meetings we will quickly go through the club business and reports, followed by Dive Talk and then a short break. The break is then immediately followed by the feature presentation.
