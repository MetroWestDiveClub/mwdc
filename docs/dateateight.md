# Date @ Eight

Looking to socialize with other divers, don't have a buddy to dive with, or not
sure where to dive?

**Date @ Eight** is the Club's regular weekly dive outing which runs year-round.
Divers rendezvous **every Saturday morning at 8:00 am** (weather and sea
conditions permitting). Dive location and updates are co-ordinated via email
weekly by our Date @ 8 Coordinator. We generally dive in the Cape Ann area,
with occasional forays to Maine and Rhode Island as weather permits other dive
sites to become attractive.

Not a member? Don't worry, Date @ Eight is open to everyone, and there is no
cost or obligation if you would like participate. One or more designated Club
representatives will be present each week to coordinate the outing for any
divers interested in participating - with or without buddies.

To join us, please email our Shore Diving Coordinator at <dateateight@mwdc.org>.

We have familiar sites, but we also enjoy trying new, safe, fun locations if you
have recommendations.

Please remember that **all divers are responsible for providing and maintaining
their own gear.**

_Non-members will be asked to show a valid C-card and sign a dive waiver prior
to diving. Site locations, days and meeting times are subject to change
according to weather forecasts, prevailing conditions, and diver safety and
ability considerations. For more details and current dive plans, contact the
Club representative listed on the left by the Thursday before the dive to let
them know you would like to attend._
