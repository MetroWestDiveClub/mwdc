        Ryan King:<br />Hidden Stories and Creative Lighting: Make your
        Images Pop
    </div>

    <p>
        <!-- presentation description goes here -->
        You’ve got the camera and lights, but so does everyone else. How do
        you get your images and video to stand out among the crowd? Snoots
        are great, but that’s just the beginning. During this session, Ryan
        King will explore some simple tools / techniques to help improve the
        stories your images tell.
