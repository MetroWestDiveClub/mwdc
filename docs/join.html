<div id="page-header">Joining Or Renewing With Our Club</div>
<br>
<div id="page-header" style="font-size: 14px">Why Join?</div>
<p>If you're on this page and not already a club member, we're glad that you're
thinking about joining us.  The club has a lot to offer to its members - be they
newly certified divers or seasoned salts.  From monthly presentations on dive-related
topics at our club meetings to lots of social activities - such as an annual
end-of-summer picnic, a Tropical Dinner Dance in the middle of February, and a
number of other social events.  We also publish a monthly electronic newsletter
that is sent exclusively to our members and a dive buddy list on the website that
is available only to members.  Being a member is certainly worth it.</p>


<p>But we don't meet to just talk about diving - an overwhelming majority of our
membership are active divers throughout
the year.  So if you're looking for people to dive with - we got you covered!  From our
weekly Saturday morning Date @ 8 shore dives, to scheduled boat dives during the
warmer season, to several annual club dive trips - we're out there diving year round!
On top of the official club dives and trips, many of our members also go diving on
their own and often are looking for buddies</p>

<p>And speaking of our members - they cover a very wide range of interests and skills.
From novices to seasoned tech and cave divers, from photographers to lobster hunters, from
reef to wreck.  There's a very large cache of experience and information that our
members would love to share with you.</p>

<p>So if you're interested in becoming a member, we invite you to come join us
at one of our club meetings.  We meet every 2nd Tuesday of every month.
Meetings are open to everyone, not just members, and you can get to know us a
little better and see what we're all about before you join our ranks. You can find
more information about our meetings <a href="meetings.html">here</a>.</p>
