# Joining Or Renewing With Our Club

## Why Join?

If you're on this page and not already a club member, we're glad that you're
thinking about joining us. The club has a lot to offer to its members - be they
newly certified divers or seasoned salts. From monthly presentations on
dive-related topics at our club meetings to lots of social activities - such as
an annual end-of-summer picnic, a Tropical Dinner Dance in the middle of
February, and a number of other social events. We also publish a monthly
electronic newsletter that is sent exclusively to our members and a dive buddy
list on the website that is available only to members. Being a member is
certainly worth it.

But we don't meet to just talk about diving - an overwhelming majority of our
membership are active divers throughout the year. So if you're looking for
people to dive with - we got you covered! From our weekly Saturday morning Date
@ 8 shore dives, to scheduled boat dives during the warmer season, to several
annual club dive trips - we're out there diving year round! On top of the
official club dives and trips, many of our members also go diving on their own
and often are looking for buddies.

And speaking of our members - they cover a very wide range of interests and
skills. From novices to seasoned tech and cave divers, from photographers to
lobster hunters, from reef to wreck. There's a very large cache of experience
and information that our members would love to share with you.

So if you're interested in becoming a member, we invite you to come join us at
one of our club meetings. We meet every 2nd Tuesday of every month. Meetings
are open to everyone, not just members, and you can get to know us a little
better and see what we're all about before you join our ranks. You can find more
information about our meetings [here](meetings.html).

## How Much Is It?

The annual dues are $55 for individual members, $70 for a family membership, $33
for a senior membership (age >= 65), and $25 for a corresponding membership

## How Do I Renew?
